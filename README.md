# HyperGraph
Code for research on asymptotic hypergraph densities. Partial research result. GPLv3


This is a bit messy and not that well commented. The code here generates data to use the method of flag algebras to get asymptotic lower bounds on the asymptotic density of even edged 3-uniform hypergraphs.
